You will learn ...
- the basic concepts and terms, of HTML and CSS, and how these two languages are linked with each other.
- to know a few basic HTML elements, CSS commands and declarations

- to edit your code using different editors and environments.

## HTML

### What you should do:
- [ ] Go to [w3schools](w3schools.com), open the HTML section and learn about at least 5 different elements and how to use them.
- [ ] On that website, use the online editor and modify or create your own HTML code using those 5 different elements.
- [ ] Copy and paste the code on your own computer, pay attention to name your file with the extension ```.html```. When you are working on a Mac, you will also need to change some settings in the TextEdit editor, please have a look [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editors.asp). You can show your HTML file on your browser by double clicking on the file.
- [ ] See how to show an image on your website [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp).
- [ ] The repository here contains an audio file. Download the audio .mp3 file or another one of your choice to your computer. See [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_audio.asp) for the HTML code required to play the audio file from within your website. You can also use the code snippet below and substitute the name of the audio file as needed. You need to copy the audio file into the same folder as your HTML file.
  
``` language=html
<div>
  <audio controls>
    <source src="220516Rec1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  </audio>
</div>
```

- [ ] Include a Youtube video to your webpage. Use the code snippets Youtube provide under the Share section below the video. You can find details on the HTML code [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_youtube.asp).
